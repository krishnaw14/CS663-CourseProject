# CS663-CourseProject

This repository contains the code, results and reports of the paper "InfoGAN: Interpretable Representation Learning by Information Maximizing Generative Adversarial Nets". 

This is done as part of CS663 (Digital Image Processing) course. 

Broad Outline of work to be done:

- [x] Build a basic Model
- [x] Replicate the results on MNIST dataset
- [x] Generate an ellipse Dataset with varying eccentricities and semi-major axis (2 degrees of freedoms)
- [ ] Infogans - try c with 1 dimension and 2 dimension or 3 dimension - see what the dimensions capture
- [ ] Try on some other binary images shape dataset, e.g., Horse shape or zebra shapes


- [ ] Add more references 
- [ ] Insights - Verify the generalizabilty of the network to other datsets
- [ ] Report
- [ ] Presentation
